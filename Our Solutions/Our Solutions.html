<p class="level1">Application Development Is More than Just Developing Applications</p>
<p>That, in a few words, is how we at Sorenoah approach our work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="surfing.jpg" width="275" height="183" hspace="15" align="right">Our commitment is to producing solutions that are robust from the outset and highly extensible over time. Every Sorenoah solution incorporates rich functionality that is extensively tested using automated testing methodologies throughout the development process; we want our applications to work flawlessly at every iteration. At the same time, our solutions are built to expand over the life of the system, all the while becoming more robust. The benefit is obvious &ndash; our solutions can easily grow and adapt to accommodate changing client business circumstances, without a major redo of coding or design.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several factors embedded in our approach to doing business make this so.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="level2">Agile Development Methodologies</p>
<p>While a thorough discussion of agile can get very complex very quickly, our processes and practices are firmly rooted in allowing rapid delivery of high-quality software through teamwork and accountability, aligning the application with client business needs and goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, cross-functional IT teams work in small increments, including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing and acceptance testing. A working product is demonstrated to stakeholders frequently. This helps minimize overall risk by allowing projects to identify and address compromises at every iteration. Contrast that with the more traditional software development scenario: months (years) of painstaking coding by multiple developers working independently culminates in a large-scale deployment may not work, because the various parts do not fit together correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Sorenoah is conversant with numerous development approaches, the majority of our practices and processes stem from agile methodologies. From our experience, they are the best means of continuously delivering useful, working solutions. Client satisfaction with visible, measurable progress is the result we strive for and value highly. Fortunately, our approach allows us to deliver on that goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="level2">Adaptive Project Management</p>
<p>Agile development is not possible without fluid oversight of a project. Sorenoah observes a three-phase process: design, execution and sustainment.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Design</strong> establishes project requirements in detail, effectively constituting the overall objectives and goals for the solution. Specific architecture and design can then be developed to produce a reliable, high performance, integrated application.</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong> involves determining the iterative functionality slated for each release and then proceeding with actual iterative development. Business champions are involved at every stage, with project planning constantly being adjusted to fluctuating needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainment</strong> is the outcome. Using the iterative Sorenoah model, deployments take place frequently, with each release incorporating previous testing and fixes, thus avoiding unexpected, and often costly, results.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="level2">Predictable, Measurable Success</span></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of the Sorenoah approach is consistent, meaningful measures of the progress of a project. We make big promises, and we have effective ways of measuring progress in order to ensure delivery. In addition to measures of progress relative to the overall solution, clients see and touch results frequently in the form of multiple, increasingly rich iterations. This leads to realizing value faster in the form of software applications that can be put to work sooner. </p>
